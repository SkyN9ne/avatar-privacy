Ideas for future development (ideas only, no promises, tell me if you'd like anything else):
* display an explanatory text/link below the comment form, let the admin change this text in the options
* display a gravatar.com sign-up link
* add a caching mechanism for the gravatar checks, clear cache every x hours
* let the admin upload a different local default image
* let users upload an image in their user profile, check for interoperability with "User Photo" and "Simple Local Avatars" plugins
* check if the plugin works together with the "Twitter User Icon" plugin
* check if not storing the checkbox value for spam comments works with other anti-spam plugins
* test the plugin with more themes (Twenty Ten, Twenty Eleven, some common frameworks)
* search for other user photo plugins and check the interoperability
* add automated tests
